Notes from Dan
    script/sitemap.sh is the first generation thing
    script/ng.sh is the next generation reorganization of the code
    intent is to bin/build bin/run
    and then i pass along a number or urls so you can bin/run 10 and it will process 10   more urls

    if you have lighthouse installed locally you can run script/sitemap.sh directly (edited)
    or you can buld the containers
    bin/build
    bin/run

To run
    Just call run script
